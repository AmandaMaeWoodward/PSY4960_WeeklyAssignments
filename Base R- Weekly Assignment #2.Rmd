# Set Up
1. Load the tidyverse library. 
> library(tidyverse)
3. Load the billboard data. 
> data(billboard)
> force(billboard)
5. What type of data is this? (e.g. describe what's in the dataset.)
This data shows the billboard top 100 for weeks 1-47 between the years 1999-2000. They have the name of the artist, track, date entered, and then followed by each week and their placement in the billboard top 100 if they were within it that week.
7. Print the column names from this dataset. 
> colnames(billboard)
9. Print the first 5 entries in the dataset. 
> head(billboard,5)
# Practice
1. Create a subset of data that has Jay-Z as the only artist. How many songs are in it?
subset(billboard,billboard$artist=="Jay-Z") 5 songs
3. In the original dataset, use filter to find information about the song "All the small things." What was the highest position this song reached on the billboard 100? 
> billboard %>% filter(track=="All The Small Things") %>% select(wk1:wk76) Highest position is wk12 at 6.
5. Create a subset of data for songs Tim McGraw sang. Summarize the data for wk 1.
> subset(billboard,billboard$artist=="McGraw, Tim") %>% select(track)
> summary(billboard$wk1)
