This quiz will focus on data frame manipulation, however, you may need to rely on skills you've learned in prior weeks. 

1. load the starwars dataset from tidyverse

2. separate the films column so that there is one film in each column (don't worry about the "c(" and ) at the end for now)

3. alter the data from wide data to long data

4. in the column where you stored the films, rename the levels so each film name is consistent (e.g. get rid of the "c(" and ")" )

5. Create a column in your dataset that indicates whether a character was in the first starwars film, *Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope* 

6. BMI is calculated as mass in Kg/height in meters. You currently have mass in Kg and height in cm. Create a column that contains each character's BMI. 

7. create a dataframe that contains only the name, hair color, and eye color for each character.
